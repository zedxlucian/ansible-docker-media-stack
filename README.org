#+TITLE: Docker Media Stack Server via Ansible
#+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only include two levels in TOC)

* General info
This will setup Docker with various media automation containers (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr..) on a Debian or RedHat server. This will also setup basic security features on the server.

* Technologies
Project created with:
+ Ansible version: 2.12.1
+ Molecule version: 3.5.2
+ Podman version: 3.2.1
+ Molecule podman version: 1.0.1
+ Docker version: 20.10.12
* TODO
+ Add variables to enable/disable containers
+ Find solution for labels if traefik container is disabled
+ Complete this README
+ Add =geerlingguy.security= role from Ansible galaxy
+ Write ansible role for Crowdsec, a great replacement for fail2ban
+ Add =no_log= parameter to tasks with sensitive informations
* Setup
** Requirements
You need to install ansible before you can run this project. It's best to get the latest version of Ansible using pip. Install pip by following instructions at: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/

and then type this command into a terminal:
#+begin_src shell
pip install ansible
#+end_src
** Usage
First clone the repository:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/zedxlucian/ansible-docker-media-stack.git
cd ansible-docker-media-stack
#+end_src

Now, you neeed to fill some variables before you can run this project. Open the file =group_vars/all= and change the values in the variable according to your needs. Now open the file =group_vars/secret.yml= and change the values.

Now you need to encrypt =group_vars/secret.yml= because it contains sensitive informations. To do so, type this command:
#+begin_src shell
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/secret.yml
#+end_src

We can finally launch our ansible playbook to install our docker media stack:
#+begin_src shell
ansible-playbook -i hosts/<your-host-ip-address> playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
#+end_src

Ansible will ask you to provide the password you used to encrypt =group_vars/secret.yml= file. Once entered, it will proceed with the playbook.
